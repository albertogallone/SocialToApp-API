# SocialToApp API
SocialToApp API Reference for Developers v3

### Getting Started
An API key is required for requests to be processed by the system. Once a user registers, an API key is automatically generated for this user. The API key must be sent with each request (see full example below). If the API key is not sent or is expired, there will be an error. Please make sure to keep your API key secret to prevent abuse.
